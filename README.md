# Digital VLSI Course @ National Technical University of Athens - 2020-21

## Description
This repository contains projects that we implemented as part of our DVLSI course during our studies. 
VHDL is used for our designs and Vivado Xilinx as the main development toolchain.
Every design is accompanied with its testbench. Also a /docs forlder for every lab contains the original assignment
& our report (in Greek).

## Components
* Lab1: Some primitives (counters, decoders, shift-regs).
* Lab2: A variety of adders (eg. Half/Full/BCD, parallel/pipelined) and a systolic multiplier.
* Lab3: FIR Filter for FPGA (3 versions - simple/pipelined/parallel).
* Lab4: Debayering Filter for FPGA.
* Lab5: Debayering Filter for a Zynq SoC FPGA using the AXI Stream interface. (HW design of Lab4 is used)
